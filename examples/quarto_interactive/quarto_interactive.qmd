## Introduction

In this example, we will try to define a Quarto document to showcase how we can use `shiny.i18n` in an interactive manner. To learn more about Quarto and how it integrates with R/Shiny, check out the [official documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/shiny/>).

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

# Since this requires a Shiny instance running, we recommend you clone this example and run it manually.
# Alternatively, if you are only looking to experience it, you can also view the deployed version at

```


## An Illustration

Here, we translate a famous quote from the one of the most famous people to have ever existed in tech, **Steve Jobs**...

```{r}

selectInput(
  "language",
  "Select language: ",
  list("English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§" = "en",
       "Polish ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±" = "pl",
       "German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª" = "de",
       "French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·" = "fr"),
  selected = "en",
  multiple = FALSE,
  selectize = TRUE
)

htmlOutput("quote")
HTML("<em>â€” Steve Jobs</em>")
br()
```

```{r}
#| context: server

library(shiny.i18n)

i18n <- Translator$new(translation_json_path = "translation.json")

output$quote <- renderText({
   i18n$set_translation_language(input$language)
   paste0("<blockquote style='text-align: justify;'>", i18n$t("quote"), "</blockquote>")
})
```
